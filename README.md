# 👋 Hi, I'm Ayush Sharma

🚀 **AI Systems Engineer | Python | FastAPI | Data Engineering**

I build intelligent backend systems that transform raw data into structured, scalable, and analytics-driven applications.

Rather than treating backend and data as separate areas, I design complete AI-ready systems — where data flows from ingestion to insight through clean architecture and optimized backend logic.

## 🏆 Flagship Project

### 🤖 Intelligent Business Analytics Platform

A modular backend system that:

- Ingests Excel datasets  
- Cleans and transforms data using Pandas  
- Stores structured data in MySQL  
- Exposes RESTful APIs using FastAPI  
- Computes revenue trends, growth metrics, and performance insights  
- Integrates with Power BI dashboards  

**Architecture Focus**

- Modular structure  
- Service-layer design  
- Optimized database queries  
- Structured API responses  

This project reflects my approach to combining backend engineering with data intelligence.
